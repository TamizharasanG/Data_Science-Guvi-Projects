In the data the price is given in their regional currency. I have used a package called easy-exchange-rates to convert the value to one common value (Indian currency value) 
INR value and proceeded for the further process. I have made a funnel chart with plotly express where it shows the comparision between the exchange rates of each country
with respect to the INR value

I have made this project into two parts in the notebook. In the first part all exploration process,explination for the new packages used are mentioned till end . 
Where as in the second part the same code is executed with some basic exploration and raw code till dashboard development.
After executing all cells from part 1 or part 2 click the link to enter the dashboard.
